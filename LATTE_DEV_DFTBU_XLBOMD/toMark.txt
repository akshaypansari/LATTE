Dear Mark,

Here is a recent highlight of how XL-BOMD can be used
in orbital-corrected DFT simulations. I have been able
to generalize our framework of the "Next generation 
extended Lagrangian first principles molecular dynamics"
to DFT+U theory. In this way it will be possible to perform 
accurate energy conserving molecular dynamics simulations 
for systems including strong electron correlation, while
completely avoiding the overhead associated with the
SCF optimization normally required prior to each force evaluation.
In orbital-corrected DFT this overhead can be significant.
I believe this first proof of principle demonstration should 
be straightforward to extend also to other DFT corrections such 
as self-interaction corrections or even Gutzwiller theory. 
Once the first initial and fully relaxed ground state optimization 
has been performed the subsequent force evaluations in a molecular 
dynamics simulations can be performed at only a fraction of the
cost in a regular simulation.
